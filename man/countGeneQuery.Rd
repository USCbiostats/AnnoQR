\title{Count the number of SNPs defined in the system that have been associated for the specified gene product.}
\usage{
countGeneQuery(gene, filter_fields = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{Gene product to search (gene id, gene symbol or UniProt id)}

\item{filter_fields}{SNP attribute labels that should not be empty for the record to be retrieved}
}
\value{
The count of SNPs matching the criteria.
}
\description{
Count the number of SNPs defined in the system that have been associated for the specified gene product.
}
\examples{
# Count SNPs associated with a specific gene
count <- countGeneQuery(gene = "BRCA1")
print(paste("Number of SNPs:", count))

# Count with filter fields
count <- countGeneQuery(
  gene = "BRCA1",
  filter_fields = c("pos", "chr")
)
print(paste("Number of SNPs:", count))
